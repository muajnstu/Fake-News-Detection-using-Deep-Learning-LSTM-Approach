The role I m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people this is a serious job,  Obama said.  This is not reality TV. Clearly, President Obama just took a shot at Trump with that statement. After all, Trump is the only candidate in the field who has been a reality TV star. Trump hosted The Apprentice for 14 seasons until his racist presidential campaign announcement caused NBC to cut ties with him. Do you think Republicans are happy with their choice?  Fallon asked President Obama.Using his great comedic timing, Obama responded,  Umm, we are,  and the audience broke out in laughter. That was too easy,  Obama continued.  The truth is that I m worried about the Republican Party. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving for the Democrats as they have gladly sat back and watched the Republican nominee tear apart the GOP piece by piece. Republicans are split on their support for Trump, especially as he continues hurling racist attacks against the judge presiding over the Trump University lawsuit.That alone has caused many Republicans to withdraw their endorsements, while other Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan have condemned Trump s racism but still support the racist for the presidency, causing even extreme conservative publisher Erik Erickson to blast Republicans for betraying their principles by supporting Trump.This is not only a preview of what President Obama had to say on the Tonight Show, it s a preview of how we can expect President Obama to deal with Donald Trump when he finally hits the campaign trail. And it s pretty clear that President Obama thinks Trump is a joke.Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"Legal expert and Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley makes a case for why we need to ADD to statues and not take them down. He says we can learn more from keeping them up in direct opposition to what Democrats are saying:TURLEY RECENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE: George Washington may have survived the winter at Valley Forge, but he may not see the end of the summer of Charlottesville. Bishop James Dukes of Chicago s Liberation Christian Center and others are calling for the removal of his and Andrew Jackson s statues and and stripping of their names from parks. Dukes insists that these monuments are  a slap in the face and it s a disgrace  for African Americans given their history as slave owning presidents.The bishop s call for the removal of our first president s statue is the latest effort to strip away the names of historical figures over ties to slavery or segregation. There is a movement to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson (who helped establish Princeton as a world academic institution) from buildings and schools, due to his support for segregation. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, but last year, University President Teresa Sullivan was denounced by students and faculty for merely quoting our third president in a public message because he was a slave owner.The call to remove Washington s statue came less than a day after President Trump asked whether Washington would be next in the movement to remove statues like the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville. The statement drew the ire of CNN s Jim Acosta who described the notion as absurd and said it was  taken as a sign that the president perhaps needs a refresher course and needs to go back to History 101.  History is precisely where this controversy should begin and end. Washington is rightfully condemned for his ownership of slaves. There were contemporaries like John Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton who were outspoken critics of slavery. Franklin called slavery  an atrocious debasement of human nature,  while Adams referred to it as a  foul contagion in the human character.  These visionaries not only saw a great evil but answered the call of history to stand steadfastly against it.However, before Mayor Rahm Emanuel sends in the bulldozers into Washington Park, it is worth considering a few facts about our first president s history with slavery. Washington inherited a number of slaves at age 11 and received more slaves in his marriage to Martha Custis. However, he gradually came to oppose slavery. On the interim, Washington tried to assuage his guilt by refusing to sell slaves that would break up families, telling an associate that it was  against my inclination to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families. After the war, Washington continued to discuss ways to convert his plantation from slaves to tenants at the suggestion of his close aide (and outspoken opponent of slavery) Marquis de Lafayette. By 1786, Washington wrote his friend Robert Morris,  I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of [slavery]. In the end, Washington was the only one of nine slaveholding presidents (and the only slaveholding founder) who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington freed as many of his 317 slaves as possible. Some 123 slaves were his to emancipate while neither he nor Martha could free the so-called  Custis Dower slaves  (who remained property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington s first husband). He further ordered that all of the elderly or sick slaves would be supported by his estate for the rest of their lives.So where does this leave us? With a complex and flawed figure who practiced a great evil while belatedly coming to reject it. He finished his life allied with his more enlightened colleagues but this is no reason to forgive his prior history. However, that is the point of history. It is never some neat narrative divided cleanly between demons and angels. Washington was a great leader who held a nation together through sheer leadership and stands as one of the few leaders in history to refuse to become a monarch himself.Curiously, Dukes does offer a concession. Washington Park and Jackson Park could be formally named after former Mayor Harold Washington and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson or singer Michael Jackson. It is unlikely to convince those who view these statutes as not simply reminders of past leaders but past struggles in an evolving society. The same cannot be said for Michael Jackson.  Thriller  may be the best selling album in history, but the Battle of New Orleans still has more of a hold on history.The fact is that we often learn as much from the failures as we do the triumphs of historical figures. Washington ultimately proved to be an early transitional figure in our ugly history of slavery. Washington himself described his desire at Mount Vernon  to lay a foundation  for a  rising generation  with a  new destiny  other than slavery.For my part, I am proud to teach at the George Washington University, whose charter was paid for by Washington himself as part of that same final testament. Of course, that does not mean we could not make other improvements. Another school in Washington is named after a British king, George II, who kept our nation under colonial oppression. After all, the moonwalk and robot dance steps did have a transformative impact on my generation  and  Jacksontown University  has a nice ring to it.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

Ted Cruz is defending a campaign mailer that Iowa s secretary of state says misrepresents election law.The mailer bills itself as a  voting violation  notice and tells the recipient it s been sent due to  low expected voter turnout in your area.  It then grades the recipient s voting history and that of several neighbors, citing public records.Cruz told reporters in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday that the mailing is  routine. He says he won t apologize for  using every tool we can  to encourage Iowa residents to vote.Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says in a statement that there s  no such thing  as an election violation related to voting frequency and that insinuating otherwise is  not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses. How is it that Ted Cruz is opposed to gov t data collection yet he s using  big data  mining to shame voters in IOWA into voting for him. Strange, very strange.Residents have been receiving notices like this one:THE COPY AT THE BOTTOM READS: You are receiving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area. Your individual voting history as well as your neighbors  are public record. Their scores are published below, and many of them will see your score as well. CAUCUS ON MONDAY TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE and please encourage your neighbors to caucus as well. A follow-up notice may be issued following Monday s caucuses . Cruz, a critic of excessive government data collection, has been notably aggressive about gathering personal information for his campaign. Some of the data comes from typical sources, such as voters  consumer habits and Facebook posts. According to several sources, a donor-funded US startup embedded in Republican s campaign has been paying UK university academics to collect psychological profiles on potential voters. The result is a personalized citation sent to Iowan voters from the Cruz campaign.On Friday evening, personalized letters target individual Iowa voters and identifies them as having failed to vote in prior elections. Much like the China  social credit  system, it knows too much about its citizens, and it identifies the neighbors of the voter, and provides their voting history and their score as well.Ted Cruz claims to be running a positive campaign and paints himself as a trustworthy conservative. Attempting to shame voters into caucusing for him with these completely fake  Voting Violation  letters is a sleazy tactic that is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouth of undecided voters. Worse still was his decision to go ahead with sending these letters not thinking he would get caught. In the social media age, when you do something bad, people are bound to find out and expose you. This was clearly a last ditch desperation tactic from a campaign that has been going in the wrong direction in the polls for weeks now.Via: Red State Watcher\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The role I m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people this is a serious job,  Obama said.  This is not reality TV. Clearly, President Obama just took a shot at Trump with that statement. After all, Trump is the only candidate in the field who has been a reality TV star. Trump hosted The Apprentice for 14 seasons until his racist presidential campaign announcement caused NBC to cut ties with him. Do you think Republicans are happy with their choice?  Fallon asked President Obama.Using his great comedic timing, Obama responded,  Umm, we are,  and the audience broke out in laughter. That was too easy,  Obama continued.  The truth is that I m worried about the Republican Party. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving for the Democrats as they have gladly sat back and watched the Republican nominee tear apart the GOP piece by piece. Republicans are split on their support for Trump, especially as he continues hurling racist attacks against the judge presiding over the Trump University lawsuit.That alone has caused many Republicans to withdraw their endorsements, while other Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan have condemned Trump s racism but still support the racist for the presidency, causing even extreme conservative publisher Erik Erickson to blast Republicans for betraying their principles by supporting Trump.This is not only a preview of what President Obama had to say on the Tonight Show, it s a preview of how we can expect President Obama to deal with Donald Trump when he finally hits the campaign trail. And it s pretty clear that President Obama thinks Trump is a joke.Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"Legal expert and Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley makes a case for why we need to ADD to statues and not take them down. He says we can learn more from keeping them up in direct opposition to what Democrats are saying:TURLEY RECENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE: George Washington may have survived the winter at Valley Forge, but he may not see the end of the summer of Charlottesville. Bishop James Dukes of Chicago s Liberation Christian Center and others are calling for the removal of his and Andrew Jackson s statues and and stripping of their names from parks. Dukes insists that these monuments are  a slap in the face and it s a disgrace  for African Americans given their history as slave owning presidents.The bishop s call for the removal of our first president s statue is the latest effort to strip away the names of historical figures over ties to slavery or segregation. There is a movement to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson (who helped establish Princeton as a world academic institution) from buildings and schools, due to his support for segregation. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, but last year, University President Teresa Sullivan was denounced by students and faculty for merely quoting our third president in a public message because he was a slave owner.The call to remove Washington s statue came less than a day after President Trump asked whether Washington would be next in the movement to remove statues like the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville. The statement drew the ire of CNN s Jim Acosta who described the notion as absurd and said it was  taken as a sign that the president perhaps needs a refresher course and needs to go back to History 101.  History is precisely where this controversy should begin and end. Washington is rightfully condemned for his ownership of slaves. There were contemporaries like John Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton who were outspoken critics of slavery. Franklin called slavery  an atrocious debasement of human nature,  while Adams referred to it as a  foul contagion in the human character.  These visionaries not only saw a great evil but answered the call of history to stand steadfastly against it.However, before Mayor Rahm Emanuel sends in the bulldozers into Washington Park, it is worth considering a few facts about our first president s history with slavery. Washington inherited a number of slaves at age 11 and received more slaves in his marriage to Martha Custis. However, he gradually came to oppose slavery. On the interim, Washington tried to assuage his guilt by refusing to sell slaves that would break up families, telling an associate that it was  against my inclination to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families. After the war, Washington continued to discuss ways to convert his plantation from slaves to tenants at the suggestion of his close aide (and outspoken opponent of slavery) Marquis de Lafayette. By 1786, Washington wrote his friend Robert Morris,  I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of [slavery]. In the end, Washington was the only one of nine slaveholding presidents (and the only slaveholding founder) who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington freed as many of his 317 slaves as possible. Some 123 slaves were his to emancipate while neither he nor Martha could free the so-called  Custis Dower slaves  (who remained property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington s first husband). He further ordered that all of the elderly or sick slaves would be supported by his estate for the rest of their lives.So where does this leave us? With a complex and flawed figure who practiced a great evil while belatedly coming to reject it. He finished his life allied with his more enlightened colleagues but this is no reason to forgive his prior history. However, that is the point of history. It is never some neat narrative divided cleanly between demons and angels. Washington was a great leader who held a nation together through sheer leadership and stands as one of the few leaders in history to refuse to become a monarch himself.Curiously, Dukes does offer a concession. Washington Park and Jackson Park could be formally named after former Mayor Harold Washington and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson or singer Michael Jackson. It is unlikely to convince those who view these statutes as not simply reminders of past leaders but past struggles in an evolving society. The same cannot be said for Michael Jackson.  Thriller  may be the best selling album in history, but the Battle of New Orleans still has more of a hold on history.The fact is that we often learn as much from the failures as we do the triumphs of historical figures. Washington ultimately proved to be an early transitional figure in our ugly history of slavery. Washington himself described his desire at Mount Vernon  to lay a foundation  for a  rising generation  with a  new destiny  other than slavery.For my part, I am proud to teach at the George Washington University, whose charter was paid for by Washington himself as part of that same final testament. Of course, that does not mean we could not make other improvements. Another school in Washington is named after a British king, George II, who kept our nation under colonial oppression. After all, the moonwalk and robot dance steps did have a transformative impact on my generation  and  Jacksontown University  has a nice ring to it.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner,  sexting,  of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages, to a teenage girl.The law enforcement official told Fox News that the laptop had  five digits  of emails, meaning tens-of-thousands of them. However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation. The source also told Fox News that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates, as the Clinton campaign has suggested.Read more: FOX News\",\n          \"Georgia senators will consider Clinton high court nominees: report Georgia\\u2019s two Republican senators broke with members of their party, saying they would consider Supreme Court nominees put forward by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Sunday. The comments from U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, who is up for re-election on Tuesday, and U.S. Senator David Perdue came after Republican Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz suggested they might block any of Clinton\\u2019s potential nominees. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t shirk your responsibility when you\\u2019re an elected official. You sanctify your responsibility, and that\\u2019s what I\\u2019ll do. I\\u2019ll consider who she nominates at the time she does and make a decision that\\u2019s right for the people of Georgia,\\u201d Isakson told the Atlanta newspaper. A spokeswoman for Perdue, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the AJC: \\u201cHe wants to ensure we have a Supreme Court justice who will uphold the Constitution, and he will examine each nominee independently based on their merits.\\u201d The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February has left the nine-member high court short one justice and evenly split between liberals and conservatives. In March, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge, to replace Scalia, but the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider the nomination, saying the next president should make the pick. The Senate\\u2019s inaction on Garland, a centrist, has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election. After many years of leaning conservative, the court could tilt to the left for the first time in decades if Clinton wins the election. Isakson said he expects the Senate will confirm Garland before January in the event of a Clinton victory. Some Republicans fear Clinton would nominate a more liberal justice, swinging the ideological\\u00a0balance of the court even further to the left. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He said there were 40,000 participants, including Boy Scouts, volunteers, staff and visitors. Trump, a Republican, started his speech before thousands of boys aged 12 to 18 in a West Virginia field on Monday evening lauding hard work and perseverance, then quickly turned to partisan attacks and ridicule of \\u201cfake media\\u201d. He attacked Democratic rivals, lambasted the current healthcare law and reminisced about a cocktail party he went to decades ago filled with \\u201cthe hottest people in New York.\\u201d Trump\\u2019s speech drew intense criticism from former Scouts, parents of Scouts and others, with many saying the speech was not in keeping with Scout values and inappropriate. While many Scouting families expressed outrage, a few said the reaction was overblown, arguing that exposure to political speech in all forms was an important part of a Scout\\u2019s development. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she had not seen Surbaugh\\u2019s letter of apology, and said she attended the event. \\u201cI saw nothing but roughly 40,000 to 45,000 Boy Scouts cheering the president on throughout his remarks and I think they were pretty excited that he was there,\\u201d Sanders said. \",\n          \"London police advise people to avoid area near station incident British police on Friday advised people to avoid the area near Parsons Green, a west London underground station, after media reports of a blast on a train.

Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner,  sexting,  of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages, to a teenage girl.The law enforcement official told Fox News that the laptop had  five digits  of emails, meaning tens-of-thousands of them. However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation. The source also told Fox News that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates, as the Clinton campaign has suggested.Read more: FOX News\",\n          \"Georgia senators will consider Clinton high court nominees: report Georgia\\u2019s two Republican senators broke with members of their party, saying they would consider Supreme Court nominees put forward by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Sunday. The comments from U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, who is up for re-election on Tuesday, and U.S. Senator David Perdue came after Republican Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz suggested they might block any of Clinton\\u2019s potential nominees. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t shirk your responsibility when you\\u2019re an elected official. You sanctify your responsibility, and that\\u2019s what I\\u2019ll do. I\\u2019ll consider who she nominates at the time she does and make a decision that\\u2019s right for the people of Georgia,\\u201d Isakson told the Atlanta newspaper. A spokeswoman for Perdue, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the AJC: \\u201cHe wants to ensure we have a Supreme Court justice who will uphold the Constitution, and he will examine each nominee independently based on their merits.\\u201d The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February has left the nine-member high court short one justice and evenly split between liberals and conservatives. In March, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge, to replace Scalia, but the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider the nomination, saying the next president should make the pick. The Senate\\u2019s inaction on Garland, a centrist, has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election. After many years of leaning conservative, the court could tilt to the left for the first time in decades if Clinton wins the election. Isakson said he expects the Senate will confirm Garland before January in the event of a Clinton victory. Some Republicans fear Clinton would nominate a more liberal justice, swinging the ideological\\u00a0balance of the court even further to the left. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

the words  radical islamic terrorism  it s as if the gop believes saying the words will magically make the terrorists go away what exactly would using this language accomplish  president obama demanded to know in remarks made last week  what exactly would it change would it make isil less committed to try and kill americans would it bring in more allies is there a military strategy that is served by this the answer is none of the above calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away but republican senator roy blunt is now accusing his democratic opponent of being weak on

important in the area of police practices and pointing to recent highprofile cases of officers killing unarmed black residents these events challenge us to do better and to work harder for progress through both dialogue and action  he said at the session s opening he added that the government has the authority to prosecute officials who  wilfully use excessive force  and that criminal charges have been brought against more than  lawenforcement officials in the past six yearsseveral countries including brazil and kenya voiced concern over the extent of us surveillance in the light of
