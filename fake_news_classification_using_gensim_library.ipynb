A lawyer for Shkreli informed the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of his intent not to answer questions and asked that he be excused from appearing, committee chairman Jason Chaffetz wrote in the letter dated Wednesday. The plan to remain silent contrasts with Shkreli\\u2019s prolific use of social media, where he has been outspoken on Twitter and livestream video even after his indictment last month on criminal charges of securities fraud. The Oversight Committee subpoenaed Shkreli to appear on Tuesday to discuss his decision as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals to raise the price of a life-saving medicine, Daraprim, by more than 5,000 percent. Shkreli, 32, has said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. On Twitter, he told followers it was \\u201cdisgusting and insulting\\u201d for lawmakers to try to subvert that right. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case \\u201cto be a witness against himself.\\u201d The dispute appeared likely to end in one of two ways: with Shkreli appearing in Washington on Tuesday to invoke that right, or with Shkreli staying home in New York, prompting the committee to vote to hold him in contempt and setting off a potential criminal prosecution. Shkreli resigned as chief executive officer of Turing last month after his arrest on the fraud charges. Turing had acquired Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug, and caused a public furor when it drastically increased the price. Fights over congressional testimony are common, especially when potential witnesses are facing criminal prosecution and their testimony could later be used against them.  Some well-known witnesses, such as former IRS official Lois Lerner and former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, refused to answer questions from Congress but were required to appear in person in front of lawmakers and cameras before invoking that right. It was unclear on Thursday whether Shkreli would make the trip to do the same. His release on bond restricts him to certain parts of New York state, and he is required to ask a judge for a waiver to travel. One of Shkreli\\u2019s lawyers has informed the Oversight Committee that Shkreli has taken no steps to seek a travel waiver, said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee\\u2019s top Democrat. \\u201cIf he plans on trying to use his own intentional inaction as some kind of bogus excuse for not showing up at Tuesday\\u2019s hearing, people will see right through such a juvenile tactic,\\u201d Cummings said in a statement on Thursday. Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, warned in his letter to Shkreli defense attorney Baruch Weiss that Shkreli could face criminal prosecution for contempt if he fails to appear. \\u201cMr. Shkreli is uniquely qualified to answer questions about rising prescription drug prices,\\u201d Chaffetz wrote. The threat of prosecution is more than theoretical. In 1952, mobster Frank Costello was convicted of contempt of Congress for failing to appear as a witness when he said he had laryngitis. Chaffetz in his letter held out the possibility of a compromise, writing that the committee may agree to hear testimony in a non-public session or to immunize the testimony so that it could not be used in the criminal prosecution. Immunizing the testimony, though, would require the support of two-thirds of the committee. Complicating the dispute is Shkreli\\u2019s decision this week to seek new lawyers, replacing a team from the law firm Arnold & Porter with others still to be named. The criminal charges against Shkreli stem from his prior management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management and biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Prosecutors said Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme, defrauding hedge fund investors and then misappropriating $11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. Shkreli, who was also until recently chief executive of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc KBIOQ.PK has pleaded not guilty, and on Twitter has called the allegations \\u201cbaseless and without merit.\\u201d \",\n          \"DETROIT (Reuters) - Quality problems prompted two of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder\\u2019s top lawyers to urge that Flint be moved back to the Detroit water system just months after a decision to draw water supply from the Flint River, according to emails released on Friday. Several critics have called for Snyder to resign over concerns about the state\\u2019s poor handling of the crisis, and the governor said Friday he felt regret every day.  Flint switched its water supply from Detroit to the Flint River in April 2014 in a bid to cut costs when the city was under a state-appointed emergency manager.  While the city switched its water source back to Detroit in October 2015, corrosive water from the river had already leached lead from city pipes, posing a serious threat to public health. Snyder\\u2019s aides discussed Flint\\u2019s water quality problems as early as autumn 2014, with one calling the situation \\u201cdownright scary,\\u201d about a year before the switch back to the Detroit system was finally made. The Detroit Free Press and Detroit News earlier reported about the emails, which were released by the governor\\u2019s office. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I\\u2019m kicking myself every day,\\u201d Snyder said after signing a $30 million supplemental bill to reimburse Flint residents for their water bills. \\u201cI wish I would have asked more questions.\\u201d       Snyder, scheduled to testify to Congress on March 17, has repeatedly apologized for the state\\u2019s poor handling of the crisis.  Liberal group Progress Michigan again called for Snyder to resign, citing the emails. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no reasonable person who can believe at this point that every top adviser to Rick Snyder knew that there was an issue, but Snyder knew nothing,\\u201d said executive director Lonnie Scott, who also called for Snyder\\u2019s resignation. Valerie Brader, Snyder\\u2019s senior policy adviser, addressed problems over the quality of Flint River water in an email to the governor\\u2019s chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, and others on Oct. 14, 2014.  She argued Flint should be returned to the Detroit water system, citing bacterial contamination and reduced quality that prompted General Motors to switch away from the river due to rusted car parts. Michael Godola, then the governor\\u2019s legal counsel, responded, calling the Flint River as a water source \\u201cdownright scary.\\u201d On Friday, State Representative Sheldon Neeley of Flint asked Attorney General Bill Schuette for his legal opinion on whether an official withholding information that leads to death or harm can be charged criminally.\",\n          \"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency called on social media giants on Friday to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure West African migrants to Libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. The smugglers often use Facebook to reach would-be migrants with false promises of jobs in Europe, International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle said. When migrants are tortured, video is also sometimes sent back to their families over WhatsApp, as a means of extortion, he said.  We really ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture,  Doyle told a Geneva news briefing. There were no immediate replies from Facebook or WhatsApp to requests by Reuters for comment. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014 and 3,091 have died en route this year alone, many after passing through Libya. This year, the number of migrants entering Europe is 165,000, about 100,000 fewer than all of last year, but the influx has presented a political problem for European countries. IOM has been in discussions with social media providers about its concerns, Doyle said, adding:  And so far to very little effect. What they say is  please tell us the pages and we will shut them down .  It is not our job to police Facebook s pages. Facebook should police its own pages,  he said. Africa represents a big and expanding market for social media but many people are unemployed and vulnerable, he said.  Facebook is pushing out, seeking market share across West Africa and pushing out so-called free basics, which allows ... a  dumb phone  to get access to Facebook. So you are one click from the smuggler, one click from the lies,  he said. Social media companies are  giving a turbo-charged communications channel to criminals, to smugglers, to traffickers, to exploiters , he added. Images broadcast by CNN last month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by Libyan traffickers. This sparked anger in Europe and Africa and highlighted the risks migrants face. Doyle called for social media companies to invest in civic-minded media outreach and noted that on Google, pop-up windows appear if a user is looking at pornography images, to warn of danger or criminality. The IOM has helped 13,000 migrants to return voluntarily to Nigeria, Guinea and other countries from Libya this year. It  provides them with transport and pocket money and documents their often harrowing testimonies.  Doyle said it was currently repatriating 4,000 migrants to Niger. Switzerland said on Friday it was willing to take in up to 80 refugees in Libya in need of protection, among 5,000 whom the UN refugee agency says are in a precarious position. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A socially conservative province where the Catholic and Protestant faiths exert strong influence, Northern Ireland allows abortion only when a mother s life is in danger. The penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment. As a result, women facing tragic circumstances such as a pregnancy resulting from rape or a diagnosis of fatal fetal abnormality, meaning that a baby will not survive outside the womb, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term.  The impact of the criminal law in Northern Ireland does amount to inhuman and degrading treatment by the state,  said Nathalie Lieven, lead counsel for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which is spearheading the legal action. The commission, an independent body, launched legal action against Northern Ireland s government in 2014, arguing that the law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been working its way through the courts ever since. A panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing. They will give their judgment at a later date. Lieven began by giving the judges an overview of detailed evidence provided by several women and girls. One of them, Ashleigh Topley, was told when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant in 2013 that her baby s limbs were not growing and she was going to die. Topley was told there was nothing to be done and she had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb, or until she went into labor which would cause the baby to die. Topley had to endure 15 weeks of anguish as the pregnancy progressed. She has described how people would ask her if it was her first child, if she wanted a boy or a girl, and other well-meaning questions which exacerbated her suffering. In the end, Topley went into labor at 35 weeks and the baby girl s heart stopped. Other cases described to the judges included that of a girl under 13 years old who was pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative. After police and social services got involved, the distraught girl had to be taken outside of Northern Ireland for the first time in her life to have an abortion. Northern Ireland s elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in February 2016. The law is far less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hundreds of Northern Irish women travel to England every year to have unwanted pregnancies terminated. As well as the parties in the case, the court will hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women.  It will also hear from groups who oppose any reform, such as Catholic bishops from the province and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes the legal action as a  crusade against disabled babies .

Khan and Trump have a history. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Khan was among many people who spoke out against Trump s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists. Trump has criticized Khan, accusing the mayor of making a  pathetic excuse  over his statement urging Londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to an attack in June. At the annual conference of his opposition Labour Party, Khan told an audience with GuardianLive that he thought having a state visit, which Prime Minister Theresa May has said is still planned, was  wrong .  I sometimes think people are ignorant,  he said, adding that it was his job to educate them. \",\n          \"CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State released a video on Tuesday that it said showed two Russian soldiers captured by its fighters in the Syrian city of Deir al-Zor, where Russia has been backing the Syrian military against militants.  But the Russian Defence Ministry denied their soldiers had been captured, Interfax news agency reported. The defense ministry, and the foreign ministry, did not immediately respond to requests for comment submitted by Reuters. In the 42-second video, released on the group s AMAQ news agency, two men appeared briefly in a room wearing gray tunics. One, with a beard, appeared to be in handcuffs. The other seemed to have bruises on his face. Reuters could not immediately verify the video. The bearded man spoke in Russian, the other remained silent, with Arabic subtitles in the video. It was dated Oct. 3, though there was no other evidence when the video was made. The bearded man, speaking to the camera, gave his name, his date of birth, and his home village in southern Russia. He then said:  I was taken prisoner during a counter-offensive by Islamic State.  He said he was taken prisoner with a second man, whose name, date of birth and home district he also gave. Amaq said late last month the militants captured two Russians as they battled in towns around Deir al-Zor. The Russian defense ministry denied then that any military personnel were taken hostage.  With Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, the Syrian army reached Deir al-Zor city in August, breaking an Islamic State siege of an enclave there that had lasted three years as the jihadist group lost ground in Iraq and Syra. With U.S.-led jets and special forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias is battling Islamic State on the east side of the Euphrates river, as they also capture swathes of Deir al-Zor province from Islamic State. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"TRUE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_processed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21192,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An attempt to change the law in Northern Ireland to allow abortions in cases of rape, incest or serious malformation of the fetus started in the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday with harrowing accounts of women s experiences. A socially conservative province where the Catholic and Protestant faiths exert strong influence, Northern Ireland allows abortion only when a mother s life is in danger. The penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment. As a result, women facing tragic circumstances such as a pregnancy resulting from rape or a diagnosis of fatal fetal abnormality, meaning that a baby will not survive outside the womb, have been forced to carry their pregnancies to term.  The impact of the criminal law in Northern Ireland does amount to inhuman and degrading treatment by the state,  said Nathalie Lieven, lead counsel for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which is spearheading the legal action. The commission, an independent body, launched legal action against Northern Ireland s government in 2014, arguing that the law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been working its way through the courts ever since. A panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing. They will give their judgment at a later date. Lieven began by giving the judges an overview of detailed evidence provided by several women and girls. One of them, Ashleigh Topley, was told when she was four-and-a-half months pregnant in 2013 that her baby s limbs were not growing and she was going to die. Topley was told there was nothing to be done and she had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb, or until she went into labor which would cause the baby to die. Topley had to endure 15 weeks of anguish as the pregnancy progressed. She has described how people would ask her if it was her first child, if she wanted a boy or a girl, and other well-meaning questions which exacerbated her suffering. In the end, Topley went into labor at 35 weeks and the baby girl s heart stopped. Other cases described to the judges included that of a girl under 13 years old who was pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative. After police and social services got involved, the distraught girl had to be taken outside of Northern Ireland for the first time in her life to have an abortion. Northern Ireland s elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in February 2016. The law is far less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, and hundreds of Northern Irish women travel to England every year to have unwanted pregnancies terminated. As well as the parties in the case, the court will hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women.  It will also hear from groups who oppose any reform, such as Catholic bishops from the province and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes the legal action as a  crusade against disabled babies .

A lawyer for Shkreli informed the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of his intent not to answer questions and asked that he be excused from appearing, committee chairman Jason Chaffetz wrote in the letter dated Wednesday. The plan to remain silent contrasts with Shkreli\\u2019s prolific use of social media, where he has been outspoken on Twitter and livestream video even after his indictment last month on criminal charges of securities fraud. The Oversight Committee subpoenaed Shkreli to appear on Tuesday to discuss his decision as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals to raise the price of a life-saving medicine, Daraprim, by more than 5,000 percent. Shkreli, 32, has said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. On Twitter, he told followers it was \\u201cdisgusting and insulting\\u201d for lawmakers to try to subvert that right. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case \\u201cto be a witness against himself.\\u201d The dispute appeared likely to end in one of two ways: with Shkreli appearing in Washington on Tuesday to invoke that right, or with Shkreli staying home in New York, prompting the committee to vote to hold him in contempt and setting off a potential criminal prosecution. Shkreli resigned as chief executive officer of Turing last month after his arrest on the fraud charges. Turing had acquired Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug, and caused a public furor when it drastically increased the price. Fights over congressional testimony are common, especially when potential witnesses are facing criminal prosecution and their testimony could later be used against them.  Some well-known witnesses, such as former IRS official Lois Lerner and former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, refused to answer questions from Congress but were required to appear in person in front of lawmakers and cameras before invoking that right. It was unclear on Thursday whether Shkreli would make the trip to do the same. His release on bond restricts him to certain parts of New York state, and he is required to ask a judge for a waiver to travel. One of Shkreli\\u2019s lawyers has informed the Oversight Committee that Shkreli has taken no steps to seek a travel waiver, said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee\\u2019s top Democrat. \\u201cIf he plans on trying to use his own intentional inaction as some kind of bogus excuse for not showing up at Tuesday\\u2019s hearing, people will see right through such a juvenile tactic,\\u201d Cummings said in a statement on Thursday. Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, warned in his letter to Shkreli defense attorney Baruch Weiss that Shkreli could face criminal prosecution for contempt if he fails to appear. \\u201cMr. Shkreli is uniquely qualified to answer questions about rising prescription drug prices,\\u201d Chaffetz wrote. The threat of prosecution is more than theoretical. In 1952, mobster Frank Costello was convicted of contempt of Congress for failing to appear as a witness when he said he had laryngitis. Chaffetz in his letter held out the possibility of a compromise, writing that the committee may agree to hear testimony in a non-public session or to immunize the testimony so that it could not be used in the criminal prosecution. Immunizing the testimony, though, would require the support of two-thirds of the committee. Complicating the dispute is Shkreli\\u2019s decision this week to seek new lawyers, replacing a team from the law firm Arnold & Porter with others still to be named. The criminal charges against Shkreli stem from his prior management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management and biopharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Prosecutors said Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme, defrauding hedge fund investors and then misappropriating $11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. Shkreli, who was also until recently chief executive of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc KBIOQ.PK has pleaded not guilty, and on Twitter has called the allegations \\u201cbaseless and without merit.\\u201d \",\n          \"Quality problems prompted two of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder\\u2019s top lawyers to urge that Flint be moved back to the Detroit water system just months after a decision to draw water supply from the Flint River, according to emails released on Friday. Several critics have called for Snyder to resign over concerns about the state\\u2019s poor handling of the crisis, and the governor said Friday he felt regret every day.  Flint switched its water supply from Detroit to the Flint River in April 2014 in a bid to cut costs when the city was under a state-appointed emergency manager.  While the city switched its water source back to Detroit in October 2015, corrosive water from the river had already leached lead from city pipes, posing a serious threat to public health. Snyder\\u2019s aides discussed Flint\\u2019s water quality problems as early as autumn 2014, with one calling the situation \\u201cdownright scary,\\u201d about a year before the switch back to the Detroit system was finally made. The Detroit Free Press and Detroit News earlier reported about the emails, which were released by the governor\\u2019s office. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I\\u2019m kicking myself every day,\\u201d Snyder said after signing a $30 million supplemental bill to reimburse Flint residents for their water bills. \\u201cI wish I would have asked more questions.\\u201d       Snyder, scheduled to testify to Congress on March 17, has repeatedly apologized for the state\\u2019s poor handling of the crisis.  Liberal group Progress Michigan again called for Snyder to resign, citing the emails. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no reasonable person who can believe at this point that every top adviser to Rick Snyder knew that there was an issue, but Snyder knew nothing,\\u201d said executive director Lonnie Scott, who also called for Snyder\\u2019s resignation. Valerie Brader, Snyder\\u2019s senior policy adviser, addressed problems over the quality of Flint River water in an email to the governor\\u2019s chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, and others on Oct. 14, 2014.  She argued Flint should be returned to the Detroit water system, citing bacterial contamination and reduced quality that prompted General Motors to switch away from the river due to rusted car parts. Michael Godola, then the governor\\u2019s legal counsel, responded, calling the Flint River as a water source \\u201cdownright scary.\\u201d On Friday, State Representative Sheldon Neeley of Flint asked Attorney General Bill Schuette for his legal opinion on whether an official withholding information that leads to death or harm can be charged criminally.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In a blog post, Bachmann absolutely loses it and goes on an enormous rant on all of Obama s supposed failures, noting that  This week, a United States president was humiliated on the world s stage by an aging, insulting Communist dictator.  While the entire post is preposterous, the real kicker is when she reveals her belief that God sent terrorists to carry out the tragic Brussels attacks to humiliate Obama and punish him because he made a historical visit to Cuba instead of attending the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference. Seriously, she even titled the post  Obama Visits Cuba While Civilization Burns . She wrote: Maybe our president s humiliation comes in a manner so devastating it makes one wonder whether the Creator of humankind isn t reminding this world of the inferiority of foolishness in the face of wisdom.The president once again mocked his nemesis, the Jewish people and the nation of Israel, by cleverly turning the international press corps toward his brilliant work in Cuba, instead of covering ongoing Islamic attacks against the Jewish state as outlined that very same day at the annual pro-Israel AIPAC meeting in Washington, D.C.History changed less than 24 hours later in the blink of an eye, and the rug was pulled out from under his well-laid plans.Obama s slavish press corps was forced to turn their uncritical gaze from adoring him to revealing the newest carnage in Brussels.Our eyes were spellbound. You can read the entire belligerent post here. To be perfectly honest, if Bachmann is trying to make Christianity look bad, she s doing an amazing job. Claiming that God would send terrorists to kill 31 and wound approximately 250 people just to soil Obama s reputation is not really a great approach for the religious right.We re sure numerous conservatives will stand behind Bachmann, confidently believing that if only the President had been at the AIPAC conference instead of Cuba, God would have been happy and the Brussels attack wouldn t have happened! Bachmann ended the post by accusing Obama for peddling the dangerous fantasy of multicultural diversity, globalization and one-world nonsense.  And by saying: The choice is ours. Which leaders will we choose? Not little big man. Not today.

Security Council on Wednesday as he urged reform to make peacekeeping missions more efficient, effective, accountable and credible. The 15-member council discussed how to improve peacekeeping operations during the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. There are currently 15 U.N. peacekeeping missions, costing more than $7.3 billion for the next year.  Since January, Trump s U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has led a push to cut costs and is reviewing the mandate of each operation as annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council. Trump wants to cap the U.S. share of the peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is  unfair.  The United States is a veto-wielding member of the council, along with Britain, France, Russia and China.  Peacekeeping missions must support a political solution; have the consent of the host country; its mandates must be realistic and achievable; every mission must have an exit strategy; and the United Nations peacekeeping missions must adjust to progress and failure,  Pence said.  In short, when a mission succeeds, we should not prolong it. When a mission underperforms, we should restructure it. And when a mission consistently fails to fulfill the mandates of this council, we should end it,  he said.  The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Wednesday pushing for improved accountability, transparency and effectiveness and to make peacekeepers more flexible. Critics worry that harsh cuts could harm operations in volatile African states.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.  Across the years and across the globe, fifty-five peacekeeping operations have successfully completed their mandate,  Guterres told the council on Wednesday.  Many political missions have done the same.  He appealed for the Security Council to ensure mandates for missions were clear and that operations were well equipped. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In a blog post, Bachmann absolutely loses it and goes on an enormous rant on all of Obama s supposed failures, noting that  This week, a United States president was humiliated on the world s stage by an aging, insulting Communist dictator.  While the entire post is preposterous, the real kicker is when she reveals her belief that God sent terrorists to carry out the tragic Brussels attacks to humiliate Obama and punish him because he made a historical visit to Cuba instead of attending the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference. Seriously, she even titled the post  Obama Visits Cuba While Civilization Burns . She wrote: Maybe our president s humiliation comes in a manner so devastating it makes one wonder whether the Creator of humankind isn t reminding this world of the inferiority of foolishness in the face of wisdom.The president once again mocked his nemesis, the Jewish people and the nation of Israel, by cleverly turning the international press corps toward his brilliant work in Cuba, instead of covering ongoing Islamic attacks against the Jewish state as outlined that very same day at the annual pro-Israel AIPAC meeting in Washington, D.C.History changed less than 24 hours later in the blink of an eye, and the rug was pulled out from under his well-laid plans.Obama s slavish press corps was forced to turn their uncritical gaze from adoring him to revealing the newest carnage in Brussels.Our eyes were spellbound. You can read the entire belligerent post here. To be perfectly honest, if Bachmann is trying to make Christianity look bad, she s doing an amazing job. Claiming that God would send terrorists to kill 31 and wound approximately 250 people just to soil Obama s reputation is not really a great approach for the religious right.We re sure numerous conservatives will stand behind Bachmann, confidently believing that if only the President had been at the AIPAC conference instead of Cuba, God would have been happy and the Brussels attack wouldn t have happened! Bachmann ended the post by accusing Obama for peddling the dangerous fantasy of multicultural diversity, globalization and one-world nonsense.  And by saying: The choice is ours. Which leaders will we choose? Not little big man. Not today.

Security Council on Wednesday as he urged reform to make peacekeeping missions more efficient, effective, accountable and credible. The 15-member council discussed how to improve peacekeeping operations during the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. There are currently 15 U.N. peacekeeping missions, costing more than $7.3 billion for the next year.  Since January, Trump s U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has led a push to cut costs and is reviewing the mandate of each operation as annual mandates come up for renewal by the Security Council. Trump wants to cap the U.S. share of the peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is  unfair.  The United States is a veto-wielding member of the council, along with Britain, France, Russia and China.  Peacekeeping missions must support a political solution; have the consent of the host country; its mandates must be realistic and achievable; every mission must have an exit strategy; and the United Nations peacekeeping missions must adjust to progress and failure,  Pence said.  In short, when a mission succeeds, we should not prolong it. When a mission underperforms, we should restructure it. And when a mission consistently fails to fulfill the mandates of this council, we should end it,  he said.  The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Wednesday pushing for improved accountability, transparency and effectiveness and to make peacekeepers more flexible. Critics worry that harsh cuts could harm operations in volatile African states.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to make U.N. peacekeeping more efficient but has noted that the current budget to fund it is less than one half of 1 percent of global military spending.  Across the years and across the globe, fifty-five peacekeeping operations have successfully completed their mandate,  Guterres told the council on Wednesday.  Many political missions have done the same.  He appealed for the Security Council to ensure mandates for missions were clear and that operations were well equipped. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vector\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
